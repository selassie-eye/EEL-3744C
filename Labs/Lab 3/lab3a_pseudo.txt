Define clock control/status and IOREG codes as constants
Define CLKEVOUT code for PORTC_6 output ("00000001")

BEGIN MAIN
	CALL CLKSEL
	SET PORTC_7 to output
	SET PORTCFG_CLKEVOUT to constant defined above
	WHILE true
	END WHILE
END MAIN

BEGIN CLKSEL
	SET CPU_CCP to IOREG (0xD8)
	WHILE OSC_STATUS is ~(status constant for desired clock)
	END WHILE
	SET OSC_CTRL to (control constant for desired clock)
	SET CLK_PSCTRL to (chosen prescalar settings)
	SET CLK_CTRL to (control constant for desired clock)
END CLKSEL
